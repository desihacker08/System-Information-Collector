# System-Information-Collector

A simple batch script for collecting and exporting system information to a CSV file. This script captures various system metrics, including CPU information, memory usage, disk usage, network speed, real-time RAM usage, and real-time location.

- **CPU Information**: Model and details of the CPU.
- **Memory Information**: Total physical memory.
- **Disk Usage**: Drive, total size, and free space.
- **Network Speed**: Adapter statistics, received bytes, and sent bytes.
- **Real-Time RAM Usage**: Available memory in megabytes.
- **Real-Time Location**: IP address, city, region, and country.

## Prerequisites

- Windows operating system
- PowerShell (included with Windows)
- Internet connection for location data

## Script Details

### File Path
File save to **Excel** format. if you change the format then you code you can change file extensation *(.txt)* and another files. 

Update the `output` variable in the script to specify where you want the CSV file to be saved:

```batch
set "output=E:\Programming\BashScript\add\system_info.csv"
```
### Date and Time
The script captures the current date and time in the format **YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS**.

## How to Use
1. **Save the Script:** Save the batch script as `system_info_collector.bat` (or any name you prefer).

2. **Run the Script:** Double-click the system_info_collector.bat file to execute it. The script will generate a CSV file with the collected information.

3. **Check Output:** Open the CSV file specified in the output variable with a spreadsheet application like Microsoft Excel to view the collected data.


## Example Output

**The resulting CSV file will contain the following columns:**

- **Category:** Type of information collected (e.g., CPU Info, Memory Info).

- **Detail:** Specific details about the information (e.g., Model, Total Physical Memory).
  
- **Value:** The actual value of the collected information.
  
- **Date and Time:** The date and time when the data was collected.

```
## Troubleshooting
- **Permissions:** Ensure you have permission to write to the specified path.

- **PowerShell Output:** Verify that PowerShell commands return the expected results.

- **File Path:** Check that the file path in the output variable is correct and accessible.
